        <h4>Channa Masala (chickpea curry) with naan</h4>
        <p>Fantastic Indian vegetarian curry recipe that I got from allrecipe contributor's mom. This is great with Indian bread (parathas, naan) or with rice.</p>
        <p>great plant-based meal that is filling, easy to make, healthy, and relatively cheap. Can be eaten alone or added alongside other indian dishes</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the tomatoes, about half the onion, the ginger, and rice flour in a blender; blend into a paste.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil and cumin seeds in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the cumin swells and turns golden brown. Cook the remaining onion in the hot oil for about 3 minutes. Stir the blended tomato mixture, garbanzo beans, curry powder, and salt into the onions; cover and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro to serve.</li>
        </ol>
